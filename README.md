# whatwedo - Docker Base Images

We at [whatwedo](https://whatwedo.ch/) are building and deploying all applications using Docker containers. For this reason we built some basic docker images. They are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/whatwedo/). You can use them easily in your own projects.

# whatwedo - Docker Base Images

We at [whatwedo](https://whatwedo.ch/) are slowly going away from traditional application hosting to the approach of using Docker containers. For this reason we built several docker images. They are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/whatwedo/). You can use them easily in your own projects.
